Other activities involved were the configuration and management of the elastix and configuration of the extensions. For example, once a client makes a call to the company through an extension number, the call first goes to the servers of the Internet service provider (ISP), then checks where the call belongs to, then it routes the call back to the company through their routers and servers and that is when the calls of the clients are received by the call centre, attended and a ticket is created that records the specific problem of the client and it is assigned to a technician so that it can be solved. holder="middle name" required><br><br>
